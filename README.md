# Deep learning and neural networks study

Hi everyone 😃

I recently started studying about deep learning and neural networks and I thought it would be good to share the resources I use to study. So I'll try to keep this list updated, but don't blame me if I get a lil bit lazy. 😅

I appreciate if you could support me by giving this repo a star ⭐


And... keep learning and good luck 😉✨
